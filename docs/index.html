            <ul>
                <p>Fast, surreal, psychedelic, and terribly chaotic, EVERDREAM is the manifestation of a fever dream in the form of a 3D shooter. </p>

            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                In the mind of every person, there is a corporation, the O-CORP, that watches over the well-being of the subconscious. As a player, you will take on the role of Agent 13, a dream agent who has just started his “dream job." In this job, you will be sent on a multitude of missions deep into the human subconscious in order to eliminate intrusive thoughts, get rid of possible threats, or simply do whatever the corporation asks you to do.
                As you progress and rise in rank within the organization, you will discover that the dogmas that the O-CORP preaches are not entirely transparent. At the same time, a mysterious entity will appear in your missions and will try to communicate with you to make you see that not everything in O-CORP is what it seems to be.

            <h3>2nd Assignment Features</h3>
            <h4>Misc.</h4>
            <p>- The ‘Street Environment’ scene is automatically loaded at the start.</p>

            <h4>Game Objects</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - The user is able to use the inspector to modify a GameObject:
                    <ul>
                        <li>         - Hierarchy: delete, reparent, create empty and create children</li>
                        <li>         - Transform: translate, rotate and scale Game Objects.</li>
                        <li>         - Mesh: select or drop any imported mesh</li>
                        <li>         - Texture: select or drop any imported texture</li>
                        <li>         - Camera is a component with settings that can be modified.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>- GameObjects can be picked from the world using the mouse.</p>
            <p>- All meshes use a bounding volume (AABB) and can be discarded using Frustum Culling. This process is visualized in the editor.</p>

            <h4>Scenes</h4>
            <p>- The user can Start / Pause / Stop the simulation and recover its original state.</p>
            <p>- The editor has 2 windows one with the scene(editor view) and another captured from a gameobject with a camera component(main game camera), each one has its own framebuffer and the user can visualize both at the same time.</p>

            <h4>Resource Management</h4>
            <p>- The user can drop/import new files. Hierarchy window reacts properly.</p>
            <p>- Asset files can be deleted through the Hierarchy window.</p>

            <h3>3rd Assignment Features</h3>
            <p>
                Demo: the scene has four buildings, one already physicalized and the other three are there to experiment with. We made the colliders a component to add so that the user could design their own experience when testing the limits and capabilities of the engine. To assign physics to an element you just have to select them, go to the inspector tab and add the physics component. The ground is static and each physics component has a checkbox for the component to be dynamic or static. (NOTE: sometimes at first it will not be dynamic by default and you have to first set it to be static and then stop it from being static).
            </p>
            <p>
                The user's camera is wrapped in a physicalized sphere capable of shooting spheres that interact with the other elements of the scene, whether the houses or the car, by pressing SPACE as many times as you want (ONLY IF IN PLAY)
            </p>
            <p>
                In the middle of the scene there are also two CUBE-type colliders joined by a point-to-point joint.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also only in PLAY will spawn a formula one racing car to control with WASD that will interact with the dynamic houses and camera spheres.
